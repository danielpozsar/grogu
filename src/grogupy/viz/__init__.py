Visualization
=============

.. currentmodule:: grogupy.viz


This submodule contains various routines to plot the system of magnetic entities
and pairs. Furthermore it will be able to plot the calculated magnetic exchange
parameters.

Functions
---------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/

    plot_contour              Plots the contour for the integration.
    plot_kspace               Plots the k-space for the Brillouin-zone sampling.
    plot_magnetic_entities    Plots the magnetic entities.
    plot_pairs                Plots the pairs.
    plot_DMI                   Plots the DMI vectors.


Background information
----------------------

Currently all the functions are using the ``plotly`` library.
This decision was made because it can be used in the Jupyter
environment and supports interactive and 3D plots.

Examples
--------

For examples, see the various functions.
